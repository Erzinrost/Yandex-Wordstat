This is a project on the automated download of keywords from Yandex Wordstat. Wordstat provides with data on the amount of searches by Yandex users of various keywords over time and across regions. Thus, these figures may be a good proxy for potential market demand, customer interest and is therefore an important tool for marketers, market researchers, etc. However, it is not possible to assess the market sentiment in any particular niche with just a few keywords, hence many of them should be considered. For that keywords download automation comes in handy, especially if semantics are particularly large. For this purpose this program has been developed, being workable as of February 2025.
