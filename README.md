**Yandex Wordstat Automated Keywords Download**

This is a project on the automated download of keywords from [Yandex Wordstat](https://wordstat.yandex.ru/). Wordstat provides data on the number of searches by Yandex users using various keywords over time and across regions. Thus, these figures may be a good proxy for potential market demand, customer interest or some marketing trends. Therefore it is an important tool for marketers, market researchers and businesses in general. However, the problem is that it is not possible to assess the market sentiment in any particular niche with just a few keywords, hence many of them should be considered. For that purpose keyword download automation comes in quite handy, especially if the related semantics are particularly large. Thus, this program has been developed to help with keywords sequential download automation.

Workable as of February 2025
